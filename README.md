# playlist-using-singly-linked-list
This project is a simulation of a Music Playlist implemented using a Singly Linked List in the C programming language.
Each song is represented as a node, and every node points to the next song, just like how a real playlist plays tracks in sequence.

## Features
- Add song at beginning
- Add song at end
- Display playlist
- Play next song
- Search for a song
- Delete a song
